This custom_component is an implementation of an idea not all too dissimilar to what the Philips Hue app calls Scenes.
Apart from that though, it has nothing to do with Hue. No bridge required.

Everything has been implemented entirely inside this custom_component, meaning that it works with every `light` entity.
No vendor restrictions. No need for special bridges.
And, most importantly, no account required :-)

## Usage

For advanced usage, use the Home Assistant DevTools and call the services provided by the custom_component directly.
Preset IDs can be found in the overview here: [assets](./custom_components/scene_presets/assets/Readme.md)

You can also get the payload for the service call for the preset you applied last by clicking on the robot icon:

## Presets

This component provides all the scene presets that were available in the Hue App scene gallery on 2023-09-28.
These have been manually extracted in a clean-room way by setting a group of lights to a scene and then noting the different x,y values + its name.
