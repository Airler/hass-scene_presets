# Scene Presets

This custom_component is an implementation of an idea not all too dissimilar to what the Philips Hue app calls Scenes.
Apart from that though, it has nothing to do with Hue. No bridge required.

Everything has been implemented entirely inside this custom_component, meaning that it works with every `light` entity.
No vendor restrictions. No need for special bridges.
And, most importantly, no account required :-)
